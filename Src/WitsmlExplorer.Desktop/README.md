# Witsml Explorer Desktop Edition

Witsml Explorer Desktop Edition is an easy-to-install version of Witsml Explorer. However, this edition does not support all features as the web application.

> :warning: **Please be aware that there is a potential risk associated with running jobs while using the desktop edition**: As the API is running locally on your machine, there is a potential risk that critical jobs may not be able to finish. This could be due to exiting the application while running a job, computer shutdown, power outage or any other cause that forces the computer or application to shut down.

## Supported operating systems

## Releasing New Version
To release a new version of Witsml Explorer Desktop Edition, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. First, bump the version number in `Src\WitsmlExplorer.Desktop\package.json` to match the version in the tag you will create in step 2. Merge in the changes to the `main` branch.
2. Create a new tag to mark the specific point in the project's history you want to release. You can use the following command:
```sh
# Create tag
git tag -a <tag_name> -m "<message>"

# Push the tag to origin
git push origin <tag_name>
```
3. Merge the `main` branch into the `stable-desktop-wex` branch to keep the current released version in its own branch.

4. Go to our GitHub page and navigate to [Actions](https://github.com/equinor/witsml-explorer/actions). Run the *Release Desktop Edition* action and use workflow from the `main` branch and type in the `<tag_name>` you used in step 1.

5. It's also a good idea to improve the release notes. You can do this from the [releases page](https://github.com/equinor/witsml-explorer/releases). Click the edit button and add the necessary notes for this release.
